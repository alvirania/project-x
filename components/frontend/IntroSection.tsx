            Most agents only reach out once or twice. Industry stats consistently show that 80% of transactions occur after the fifth attempt — yet only 8% of Realtors make more than three calls.

            Agents get buried juggling hundreds of tasks, questions, and paperwork — leaving tens of thousands of dollars unclaimed in their databases. BrokerNest fixes that.
